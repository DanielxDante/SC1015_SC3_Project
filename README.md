# Food Delivery Analysis

## All about our project...
---
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on investigating the reasons why there is an increase in demand for online delivery in metropolitan cities such as Singapore. Our dataset is set in a metropolitan city in India, Bangalore. All walkthroughs will be on a single file.

## Problem Definition
---
- What are the optimal factors for a restaurant to attract consumers via food delivery service?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Classification Models Used
---
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier

## Conclusion
---
The top 3 things that customers look out for in food delivery services are:
- Ease and Convinience of Delivery
- Services that Save Time
- More Offers and Discounts 

The model that produces the best score would be the Random Forest Model. However, it is possible that the most optimal classification model would be the XGBoost classifier for reasons stated in our walkthrough.

## What did we learn from this project?
